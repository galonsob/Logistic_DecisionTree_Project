# Logistic_DecisionTree_Project:Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction  

## Project Overview  
This project addresses the high rate of hotel booking cancellations and no-shows, which cause significant revenue loss and operational inefficiencies in the hospitality industry. Using historical booking data from **INN Hotels Group**, the goal was to **analyse the factors that influence cancellations** and build a **predictive Machine Learning model** to identify high-risk bookings in advance.  

## Objectives  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key drivers of cancellations.  
- Develop and evaluate **predictive models** to classify whether a booking will be canceled.  
- Provide **business insights** to support cancellation/refund policy design and improve operational efficiency.  

## ðŸ› Methodology  
- **Data preprocessing & feature engineering** (handling categorical features, missing values, encoding).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations to detect trends and correlations.  
- **Model building & evaluation:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and comparison of performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score).  
- **Interpretability:** Feature importance analysis to understand business drivers.  

## Results & Impact  
- Identified **lead time, previous cancellations, price per room, and special requests** as the most influential factors.  
- Built a **robust predictive model** that helps hotels flag risky bookings in advance.  
- Insights can support strategies for **dynamic pricing, overbooking, and refund policies**.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
